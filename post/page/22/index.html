We get a succession of battles -- five, I think -- between a band of Mexican Indian revolutionaries and a pig-headed general.
Jim Brown gets mixed up in it because he has come down from the States to arrest Burt Reynolds for sticking up a bank.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Melissa Diaz Carrasco Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</h2><time>Jul 12, 2024</time>
