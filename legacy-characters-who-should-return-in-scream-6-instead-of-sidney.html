That means this next entry in the Scream saga will be the first not to include Woodsboro’s toughest survivor.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>What Scream 6 directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett – part of the filmmaking collective Radio Slence – possibly need to do is to take a look at the franchise’s history and bring back another legacy character or two to fill Campbell’s place. Here are just a few suggestions for characters we would love to see make a surprise comeback in Scream 6 when it hits theaters in March 2023.</p><h3 id=h-dewey-riley-david-arquette data-injectable=false>Dewey Riley (David Arquette)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dewey-David-Arquette-Scream-2022.jpg><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>2022’s Scream broke the mold by actually killing off one of the core trio, with poor Dewey finally meeting his end at Ghostface’s hands in one heartbreaking and harrowing scene. Death isn’t necessarily the end for David Arquette’s time in the franchise, however, as that same movie proved. If Skeet Ulrich got to return as Billy Loomis via a hallucination, then there’s nothing stopping Arquette from featuring in one more cameo as former Sheriff Riley.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Arquette has been pretty involved in Scream 6 in the run-up to its shoot, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on Neve Campbell’s exit</a> in interviews and posting about it on social media, so it certainly seems like he hasn’t cut ties with the Scream universe yet. Maybe we could get a flashback featuring Dewey as Gale remembers happier times with her ex-husband?</p><h3 id=h-jill-roberts-emma-roberts data-injectable=false>Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/scream-emma-roberts.png><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>As said above, Scream ’22 tore up the rule book by devising a way for former Ghostface killers to return. So if Billy can come back as a “Force ghost” then why not have another memorable mass-murderer from the franchise’s past return in Scream 6? Why not invite Emma Roberts aboard as Jill Roberts, the fake final girl/twist killer from Scream 4?</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>The last movie already honored Scream 4 by bringing back Marley Shelton’s Judy Hicks, so Radio Silence clearly aren’t afraid to draw from this somewhat divisive entry in the saga. Also, those who are loyal to Scream 4 would absolutely lose it if Jill showed up again. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberts has even admitted</a> she feels like she’s not “done” with the saga.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>As for how it could happen, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hayden Panettiere’s Kirby</a> could always be suffering from visions from the best friend who once tried to kill her, now that she’s been drawn back into Ghostface’s sphere. This could also allow for Rory Culkin to return as Charlie, Jill’s accomplice.</p><h3 id=h-the-cast-of-the-stab-movies data-injectable=false>The Cast of the Stab movies</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Since Scream 2, the series has brought on board actual stars to play versions of themselves in the fictional Stab movies, the in-universe horror franchise based on the Ghostface killings. Memorably, Heather Graham played Drew Barrymore’s Casey, Tori Spelling was Stab‘s Sidney Prescott, while Luke Wilson appeared as fake Billy. Scream 4 likewise added the likes of Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin into the Stab-verse.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>It could be a lot of fun, then, to have at least one of these Stab movie veterans return as a callback to their earlier cameos in the saga. Scream 6 will be leaving Woodsboro behind in favor of New York, which could potentially lead to some skewering of showbusiness ⁠— as with Scream 3 and its Los Angeles setting. If that’s the case, then please, Radio Silence, invite Luke Wilson back to recreate his iconic “stupid!” moment from Scream 2.</p><h3 id=h-jennifer-jolie-parker-posey data-injectable=false>Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jennifer-jolie-scream-3-e1655414286130.jpg><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>Scream 3 is easily the least-liked installment in the franchise as it got a lot of things wrong. It wasn’t all bad, however, as it gave us the one and only Jennifer Jolie, the actress who plays Gale in Stab 3 who is brilliantly portrayed in OTT fashion by Parker Posey. Fans have often lamented that the character was killed off in Scream 3 preventing her from returning in subsequent sequels.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>What if Scream 6 revealed that reports of Jennifer’s demise were greatly exaggerated? Sure, she definitely seemed to have expired during her brutal Scream 3 death scene, but it’s not like the series hasn’t pulled the rug from underneath us before, especially as Panettiere’s comeback retcons Kirby’s own death in Scream 4.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>With Gale having neither Dewey or Sidney to be paired with in Scream 6, it could be fun to have her team up with another legacy character, allowing us more of Cox and Posey’s excellent comic chemistry in the process.</p><h3 id=h-mark-kincaid-patrick-dempsey data-injectable=false>Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sidney_Mark_Scream_3_2000.jpg><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>When Sidney is reintroduced in Scream ’22, we find out that she’s finally managed to escape the shadow of her dark past and settle down with a husband and child. We don’t find out who her husband is, but Gillett and Bettinelli-Olpin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have confirmed</a> that it’s their intention that Sidney got hitched to Mark Kincaid, the brave detective from Scream 3 played by Patrick Dempsey.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>This raised hopes that Dempsey would return in the next film as we perhaps got to dig deeper into Sidney’s home life. Unfortunately, that’s no longer going to happen, due to Campbell’s exit, but that doesn’t mean Mark can’t appear separate from his wife. As a homicide detective, it would be extremely easy to bring him into the plot as a new spate of Ghostface killings occurs. He could even fill the role that Dewey would typically have in the story.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Plus, with her husband around, Sidney’s presence would still be very much felt, which would help smooth over the giant chasm that Campbell’s absence creates.</p><h3 id=h-stu-macher-matthew-lillard data-injectable=false>Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Matthew-Lillard-Scream-1996-Featured.webp><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>A familiar face we most want to see return in Scream 6 has to be Stu Macher. In the run-up to this year’s reboot, fans became obsessed with the idea that Stu would be revealed to have survived the events of the first movie and would be back for revenge in the fifth film. Not only was this the original plot for Scream 3 before the idea was junked, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Lillard heavily campaigned</a> to come back as Stu on social media and to the press.</p><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>So it was ironic that his on-screen serial-killing partner Skeet Ulrich was the one who returned in Scream 5 instead. Scream 6 can put that right and finally bring Stu back from the dead. Lillard’s crazed turn as one of the original Ghostface killers remains among the finest performances in any of the movies, so it would be mind-blowing to see him revisit the character all these years later. Plus, his return could address those widespread theories that Stu was really in love with Billy. If that’s the case, then what would he make of Billy’s daughter, Sam (Melissa Barrera)?</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Scream 6 shouldn’t be all about looking to the past, obviously, but a couple of returning cast members would go a long way to ensuring it feels like an authentic next chapter in the saga’s blood-soaked history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo56fkZjGbq%2FHmqmam6Sav7R51qGmZquYpMKtsIyrnK2toqN6qrqMrJqrnZGiend5yKeqrZ2RmXqwsoysoJ2mla58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julianna-pena.html><span>←</span><span>Julianna Pena- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</span></a>
