Born and raised in Worcester’s Vernon Hill neighborhood, Levy’s journey from a local kid to a prominent public figure is a testament to his unwavering commitment to his community.&nbsp;Levy’s political career began in 1975 when he secured a seat on the Worcester City Council, a position he held for nearly two decades until 1993.</p><p>Beyond his roles as mayor and councilor, Jordan Levy extended his influence to the state level. He served as a member of the Massachusetts Governor’s Council from 1994 to 1998, where he continued his dedication to public service. His involvement with the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority further underscored his commitment to improving the infrastructure and transportation systems of the state.</p><p>However, it was not just his political career that defined Jordan Levy but also his powerful presence in the media landscape. For years, Worcester residents tuned in to hear his distinctive voice on the conservative radio station WTAG, where he hosted a weekday show from 3 to 6 p.m. His show was a platform for discussion, debate, and the exchange of ideas, reflecting his passion for open dialogue and the free expression of opinions.</p><p>In recent months, his absence from the airwaves had been felt by his dedicated listeners. Kate Toomey, At-Large City Councilor, expressed the sentiments of many in Worcester when she tweeted, “Such a loss for Worcester! Former Mayor Jordan Levy had an incredible presence in Worcester. One of the ‘greats’! When he became ill and couldn’t do his show, we experienced a ‘great silence’ in the City. Whether he agreed with you or not, and he certainly let you know, Jordan Levy is a Worcester original.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKfp7GiuoylnK%2BxXaSvqsDUmqmyZZakv66x0WauqKqTmsC1sdFmpJqxn6d6orrDZq6tmZditbC%2F02afmqtdmbamsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-markiplier-starting-an-onlyfans.html><span>←</span><span>Is Markiplier starting an OnlyFans?</span></a>
