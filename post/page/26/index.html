Recommended Videos Rosamund Pike is no stranger to subversive or disturbing movies. Though she gained fame for conventional roles in James Bond and Pride & Prejudice, we will not soon forget the incomparable David Fincher film Gone Girl. Pike’s performance of Amy Elliot Dunne was the epitome of gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss in 2014. Faking her own death and pinning it on her cheating husband were just some of the many crimes perpetuated in the film.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lightyear star Chris Evans blasts homophobic scorn by some online naysayers</h2><time>Jun 28, 2024</time>

There are few people on this planet who enjoy a fanbase as rabid as that of Donald J. Trump. The former president emerged, all the way back in 2015, as the Republican party’s surprise frontrunner, and he’s served as the party’s unofficial head every day since. That could be about to change, however, as those once-fanatical followers start to drop off in the wake of Trump’s embarrassing legal woes.
Recommended Videos Trump’s supporter base has long been his claim to fame, allowing him to cling to relevance even following his 2020 loss, copious shameful gaffs and purposeful acts of malice, and mounting legal costs that could finally see the former billionaire bleed his accounts dry.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Plays Matthew Patel in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off?</h2><time>Jun 28, 2024</time>

Following the much awaited weekend battle at the box office of new releases Barbie and Oppenheimer, a map breaks down which states showed a preference for each film over the weekend, with results falling along shockingly political lines.
The pair of films grossed a combined $235.5million at the domestic box office - Barbie accounting for $155million of that figure, and Oppenheimer for the other $80.5million.
One Instagram account further broke down those numbers by using a US map to illustrate which states sprung for the origin of the nuke, and which wanted to dissolve into a world made out of pink.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lone Star movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1996)</h2><time>Jun 27, 2024</time>
