Tapping on the button takes you to an area of TikTok where you can buy lip gloss, kitchen appliances, and new jeans, usually at a discounted price so good it‚Äôs hard to believe.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Could that skepticism be warranted?&nbsp; TikTok Shop is incredibly easy to use and touts itself as safe for both consumers and business owners, so here‚Äôs all we know about its safety measures.</p><h2 id=h-is-tiktok-shop-safe-for-consumers data-injectable=false>Is TikTok Shop safe for consumers?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@itschelseahope href=#>@itschelseahope</a><p>I thought this was going to be so small I‚Äôm in shock ü´¢ <a title=leatherpurse href=#>#leatherpurse</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ new romantics sped up - r & m 3 ‚∏Ü‚∏â" href=#>‚ô¨ new romantics sped up ‚Äì r & m &lt;3 ‚∏Ü‚∏â</a></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>It‚Äôs as safe to shop on TikTok Shop as it is to shop on most online marketplaces; you should exercise as much caution as you would when making a purchase on, say, Amazon or Etsy. TikTok has said all merchants and product listings must adhere to its policies, as well as community guidelines.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>That being said, some users have fallen victim to scams on TikTok Shop, so some false listings definitely slip through the cracks. Most listings are legit, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">be as careful as you would using any other online marketplace</a> to minimize your risk of being scammed.</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=805 data-injectable=true>If you‚Äôre worried about sharing your credit card information with TikTok, be aware it uses PayPal and Stripe (both of which it describes as ‚Äútrusted third party payment platforms‚Äù) when processing payments. Both are frequently used by online retailers, and are considered relatively safe. TikTok claims US users‚Äô data is stored in the US and as part of Project Texas, they are actively in the process of deleting stored data. None of this means data breaches aren‚Äôt a possibility, but TikTok Shop is about as safe as any online shop.</p><h2 id=h-is-tiktok-shop-safe-for-businesses data-injectable=false>Is TikTok Shop safe for businesses?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@skincarebakeryshop href=#>@skincarebakeryshop</a><p>Replying to @Tamieka(Grand T) ready for a MAGICAL GLOW ü•π‚ú® Ice Me Out will have you SPARKLING from head to toe ü•πüíé <a title=bodybutter href=#>#bodybutter</a> <a title=glowybodycare href=#>#glowybodycare</a> <a title=skincarebakery href=#>#skincarebakery</a> <a title=tiktokmademebuy href=#>#tiktokmademebuy</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viraltiktokbusiness href=#>#viraltiktokbusiness</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=viraltiktokbusiness href=#>#viraltiktokbusiness</a> <a title=tiktokshop href=#>#tiktokshop</a> <a title=viralskincareproducts href=#>#viralskincareproducts</a> <a title=glitterskincare href=#>#glitterskincare</a> <a title=glitterbodybutter href=#>#glitterbodybutter</a> <a title=tiktokmademebuy href=#>#tiktokmademebuy</a> <a title=viraltiktokshop href=#>#viraltiktokshop</a> <a title=viralskincare href=#>#viralskincare</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - All Things Festive" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì All Things Festive</a></figure><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=false>TikTok makes money by taking a percentage of sales made on TikTok Shop, so be aware before you sign up as a seller. Many sellers, especially small businesses, have found themselves happily fulfilling a large amount of orders thanks to the feature, but your mileage may vary. Other business owners have complained of late payments and issues setting up their TikTok Shops. As with most online marketplaces, do your research before deciding if selling is beneficial for your business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qr%2BMraCkrJ%2BgerS0zqlkpZ2XnsFurc2dZKyZlpp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elise-finch-age-wiki-married-husband-bio-net-worth-kids-height.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Elise Finch Age, Wiki, Married, Husband, Bio, Net Worth, Kids, Height</span></a>
