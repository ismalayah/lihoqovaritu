Recommended Videos The Rambler – A man who knows not where he’s going, or what to expect, yet he blindly follows the road ahead and every adventure it may bring. He doesn’t have a purpose, a care in the world, a destination, or even a good reason for the life he leads, he just, well, he just is. Sounds like a kooky premise for a film, eh? A mysterious man who wanders from city to city, getting in to all sorts of trouble just for the sake of weirdness?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bepper Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos Pokemon has had an interesting history. Aside from the ever popular main line of games, of which we actually have a new set coming later this year, the franchise has had the misfortune of having potentially more spin-offs than any other series in history, and most of them failing to live up to the popularity of the series’ roots.

Of course the Carroll book was more than this; he struck a personal note, of a kid who despite his suffering tried to turn his experience into poetry. The problem with Scott Kalvert's film is that the camera tends to make the experiences too literal: Jim, the hero of the story, is so desperately sick and unhappy that the romanticism seems unconvincing. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wet, not touching.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Briar Rose Christensen</h2><time>Sep 14, 2024</time>
