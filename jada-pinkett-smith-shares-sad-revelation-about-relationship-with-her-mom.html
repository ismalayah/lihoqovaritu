On a recent episode of "Red Table Talk," Jada and Adrienne Banfield-Norris revealed a lack in their past connection while interviewing author Kelly McDaniel, who penned "<a href=# rel=sponsored data-ga-event={ category ecommerce click www.amazon.com mother-hunger-understand-nurturance-protection dp data-ml-dynamic=true data-ml-dynamic-type=sl data-orig-url="https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Hunger-Understand-Nurturance-Protection/dp/1401960855?tag=nypost-20&asc_refurl=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/jada-pinkett-smith-and-mom-talk-about-what-was-missing-from-relationship/&asc_source=web" data-ml-id=0 data-ml=true data-xid=fr1653590579774hfa class=norewrite>Mother Hunger: How Adult Daughters Can Understand and Heal From Lost Nurturance, Protection and Guidance</a>."&nbsp;Banfield-Norris said in a clip obtained by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>,&nbsp;"One of the things that was so missing in my relationship with my mother and with Jada was just touch."</p><p>With Jada confirming the deficit in "cuddles" as a child, Banfield-Norris added, "It's awkward because we didn't hug in our family. We knew we were loved, but it just wasn't that kind of nurturing touch" (per the<a href=#>&nbsp;New York Post</a>). The 68-year-old now hugs granddaughter Willow Smith plenty, telling the "Emo Girl" singer fondly, "It felt so good to be able to have that." Unfortunately, as Banfield-Norris shared, "I missed it with Jada."</p><p>Banfield-Norris was far from being an absent mother, however. During the same episode, Jada divulged how&nbsp;Banfield-Norris "saved [her] life again" when she cautioned her against boarding a stranger's boat in Italy once, per <a href=#>People</a>. Jada, who was "about to get on that boat," heard her mother's warning that "if something happens to you, nobody's gonna hear you," snapping her out of it. She reminisced, "I said, 'Oh, snap, Mom. You right.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9maIZ4e8mam5ploJ67rLHTrWSspZmptW6%2Fx5qpnqtdqK6ledGerZ6kkam2sLqMmpmoraRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedaiq6FlmJq%2FbrnOpmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amc-interview-with-the-vampire-tv-review-2022.html><span>←</span><span>AMC's Interview with the Vampire is a Cheesy but Curious Series Adaptation | TV/Streaming</span></a>
