Companies like Ryanair and Wendy’s toe this tightrope excellently, and their slightly insulting social media accounts chime nicely with what their brands represent. But when it goes wrong, it goes terribly wrong, as shown by the latest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Netflix</strong></a> tweet about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love is Blind</a> reunion livestream, well, not going live.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well, we said anything could happen… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WMSkirp4Io</a></p>— Netflix (@netflix) <a href=#>April 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>Unlike the ultra-cheap airline and the fast food chain famed for its iconic frosties, Netflix is supposed to be a user-first, slick tech operation. So, making a joke about the fact the Love is Blind reunion livestream was a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> complete technical failure</a>, only running 75 minutes after it was supposed to go live (and only for certain U.S. audiences), isn’t the best look for the streaming giant. When you also take into account the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ethical issues around the hit dating show</a>, this is looking increasingly like a real issue for Netflix.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>Most Twitter users were happy to let the streaming service know how they felt about this attempt at making light of their error, with almost all the replies to the tweet being negative.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netflix really said <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BijgGp5vCh</a></p>— Aneesh the Actress🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ (@aneeshshethacts) <a href=#>April 18, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yyo2pTQiDL</a></p>— Lisa McKinnon ☮️ (@805foodie) <a href=#>April 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>There was no reason given for the technical delay, but in a statement (that actually did get the tone right) viewers were given an apology. This took place at roughly 2.30am in the U.K., around an hour and a half after the show was due to begin, frustrating audiences on the eastern side of the Atlantic who’d stayed up to watch.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Netflix filmed the show instead, and released it later that day. While this might seem like a decent compromise, it meant that social media was already flooded with spoilers, as some had been able to watch the show and comment on it. Those who’d planned to wake up and indulge in the reunion were left without any content, too.</p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>The Netflix statement that wasn’t an attempt at a joke read:</p><p>“To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned.We’re filming it now and we’ll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.”</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Love is Blind host Vanessa Lachey, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many fans have their own issues with</a>, posted a live video on Instagram with the caption “Apparently we broke the internet,” which was of scant consolation to viewers who’d stayed up to watch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Where do I sign the petition to never have her host this show ever again???<a href=#>#LOVEISBLINDreunion</a> <a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a> <a href=#>#LoveisBlind4</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/c6ETkbZ1iE</a></p>— Corinne (@champagnecoc_o) <a href=#>April 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>There is every chance Netflix could have gotten away with this huge mistake if it had produced a decent bit of content, but users who did bother to wait until the show was up were left feeling underwhelmed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The most memorable thing about it was having to wait a day to be able to see it.

Maybe in the future, it should stick to streaming, or at least learn to apologize correctly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6KwXam%2FqrHSZquoZaOasm7Ax55kn62eo8Zuv8idnGahnmLBqbGMpaavnV2ewG6uy6KlnWWUnsCiv9OeqWaapal6tbTEZpuapZGcsm610maYpaqVlrG6ecOopZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-chrisean-rock-and-what-is-she-famous-for.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Chrisean Rock and what is she famous for?</span></a>
