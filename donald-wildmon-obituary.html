In June 1977, driven by his concerns about the appropriateness of primetime television for families, Wildmon relocated to Tupelo, Mississippi, establishing the National Federation for Decency (NFD), which later evolved into the American Family Association.</p><p>His activism began with the NFD’s first television advertiser boycott in 1978, targeting Sears for sponsoring programs he deemed inappropriate. This initiative marked the beginning of a series of campaigns and boycotts aimed at influencing corporations to refrain from supporting content that clashed with the organization’s values.</p><p>In 1980, Wildmon founded the Coalition for Better Television (CBTV), boasting a nationwide membership of 5 million, to continue his efforts in promoting responsible television. His commitment to decency was evident in successful endeavours like the 1986 boycott that led 7-Eleven to remove adult magazines from its stores.</p><p>Throughout the late 1970s, Wildmon actively protested television series that, in his view, promoted immoral lifestyles, including Three’s Company, MAS*H, and Dallas. His dedication to decency reached an international stage with the 1991 documentary Damned in the U.S.A., chronicling his battles with artists Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. The documentary earned acclaim, winning the International Emmy for Best Documentary.</p><p>In 2009, Wildmon faced health challenges, battling St. Louis encephalitis and undergoing surgery for cancer on his left eye. Despite his resilience, he announced his retirement as chairman of the American Family Association on March 3, 2010, passing the torch to his son Tim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfo66tsIywoKWcnaS7brvBoquumaKufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-of-the-strangest-things-the-simpsons-has-predicted.html><span>←</span><span>15 of the strangest things The Simpsons has predicted</span></a>
