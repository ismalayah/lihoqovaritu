From runway looks to maxi challenges, double shantays to double sashays, the Pit Stop is where we go to unpack it all.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Officially launching in 2016 with RuPaul’s Drag Race season eight, the Pit Stop has become as vital to the full experience of RuPaul’s Drag Race as has Untucked, the behind-the-scenes drama-filled spin-off that succeeds every new episode.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>In previous years, The Pit Stop has seen several repeat hosts, such as Raja, Trixie Mattel, and Bob The Drag Queen, all of whom won their respective seasons, be it regular seasons or All Stars. Up until Manila Luzon, who hosted season 11, every Pit Stop host had been a previous winner. The unofficial rule was thrown into flux with Manilla, but Bob, Trixie, and Monét righted the ship in the subsequent three seasons following Manila. Now that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season 15 is officially upon us</a>, it’s time for a new host, and thankfully, it’s another previous winner. In fact, one who has never hosted the Pit Stop before.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-which-drag-queen-is-the-new-host-of-the-pit-stop data-injectable=false>Which drag queen is the new host of The Pit Stop?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bianca Del Rio (@thebiancadelrio)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Season 15 of The Pit Stop will be officially hosted by none other than the insult comedian herself, Bianca Del Rio.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Bianca is no stranger to The Pit Stop, having made multiple appearances as a guest host throughout the years. In fact, after appearing in seasons 11, 12, 13, and 14, we were all but shouting “just make her the host already!” Thankfully, Ru listened.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>As judge of The Pit Stop, Bianca will finally get the chance to sit down and watch each new episode in full, something she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> has not happened in several years.&nbsp;</p><p>“I must be honest, and I’ve said it many times before, that I have not kept up with all 15 seasons and all 96 franchises. But this was one time I was having a moment to sit down and actually watch the show, revisit it and enjoy it again. I also give my critiques in my usual cheeky manner, which is exciting for me because I really haven’t had a chance to sit down and watch it uninterrupted. And this is the first time I’m doing it. I told everyone the reason why I’m doing it is that I’m being paid. So that’s how it’s working for me.”</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>Those who expect Bianca to whip the new queens with her tongue have another thing coming. The season six winner has apparently grown soft in recent times.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s crazy to say, but I must admit that as cynical as I can be, I have fallen back in love with the show again. So, I might not be as nasty as I usually am. This one is really tugging on me.”</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=false>With the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">largest cast RuPaul’s Drag Race has ever seen</a>, Bianca will have her work cut out for her as she and her guest unpack each new episode and predict who will be crowned “America’s Next Drag Superstar.” The Pit Stop is available on the official RuPaul’s Drag Race YouTube channel every Saturday following each new episode of RuPaul’s Drag. Season 15 will premiere on MTV starting Jan. 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlpJ2ybrrEsatmoJ%2BowW67xWanoqxdqMGwvIyfpqtloqq9osHLrGSdqpGcerOtwp5krJ2RqLyveZBuZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-zaillian.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Zaillian movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
