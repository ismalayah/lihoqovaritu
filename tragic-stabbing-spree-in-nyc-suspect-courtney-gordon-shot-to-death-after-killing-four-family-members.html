The suspect was fatally shot by responding police officers after he allegedly attacked them with a kitchen knife.</p><p>The harrowing event began when a distressed teenage girl made a 911 call, fearing for her family’s lives. When officers arrived at the scene, they were met with a chaotic situation. Gordon reportedly attacked the officers, injuring two of them before he was shot dead.</p><p>Amidst this turmoil, firefighters battled a blaze that had engulfed the home, delaying the officers from entering the residence. Tragically, an 11-year-old child was found dead outside the house, and three more victims were discovered inside, all believed to have been fatally stabbed by Gordon.</p><p>The injured officers were rushed to Jamaica Hospital and are expected to make a full recovery. Patrick Hendry, PBA President, underscored the unpredictable nature of police work and the challenging circumstances the officers encountered during this horrific incident.</p><p>An investigation is currently underway to determine the cause of the fire and to piece together the events leading up to this tragic incident. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to the victims’ family and friends during this difficult time.</p><p><strong>More From BRBNEWS: <a href=#>Indian Lake High School Student Nolan Purk Dies in Car Accident</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaopewsLjLnp6eZpmjfLW%2BwKCgnGWjqa6jrsinnmaroKeypnnIp2SnsZNiwLa%2Fz56arWWTpMKzwM2esGafn6exsLqMrJ%2BorF2pvG6wxJqroWWRm8GmvoykoKWkmaO0brLOrqlmnpGitq3FjKacppqVp8Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./susumu-chiba.html><span>←</span><span>Susumu Chiba - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
