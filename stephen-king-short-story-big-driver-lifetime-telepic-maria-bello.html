After recovering from her injuries, the novelist uses the detective skills she picked up from writing mystery novels to track down and take revenge on the trucker and his accomplices.</p><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>It’s pretty disturbing material for a TV movie, and King’s short story was sickeningly graphic, so perhaps&nbsp;Lifetime will tone it down a bit, if just so it doesn’t have to carry a TV-MA rating. As of right now, the only reason I’d watch Big Driver is Bello. She’s a supremely talented actress, and I’ll be interested to see how she does in the role of a victim-turned-vigilante. The story, though powerful, wasn’t one of King’s&nbsp;best, but it’s still filled with some extremely creepy and dramatic moments befitting a work from the Master of Horror.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Richard Christian Matheson, who previously penned&nbsp;Happy Face Killer for Lifetime and also wrote an episode&nbsp;of the 2006 miniseries&nbsp;Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King&nbsp;will be scribing the adaptation.
