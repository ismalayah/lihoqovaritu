<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>House of the Sleeping Beauties movie review (2009)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The film centers on five scenes in which Edmond, a dying man in his 60s (<a href=#>Vadim Glowna</a>, who also directed), lies in bed next to sleeping nude women of about 20, all breathtakingly beautiful, and delivers a mournful interior soliloquy about his age, their perfection, his mother, a childhood sexual experience and his own misery. This is an intensely depressing experience for Edmond, and for us, intensified by his robotic smoking habit. Sometimes he shakes a woman or slaps her on her butt, but if anything is going to wake her up, his breath will.</p><p>Surrounding these scenes is a plot more intriguing than they deserve involving Edmond's old friend, Kogi (<a href=#>Maximilian Schell</a>), who advised him to visit the brothel in the first place. Kogi is concerned that Edmond is still so depressed by the death of his wife and young daughter in an auto accident. This happened 15 years ago. I think the human ability to heal ourselves is such that, after 15 years, you can expect to be sad and deeply regretful, but if you are still clinically depressed, you need medical attention.</p><p>It is also a wonder that this shambling sad sack and secret drinker is still apparently the head of a big corporation and has a full-time driver for his stretch BMW. Here is one tycoon who could definitely not be played by <a href=#>Michael Douglas</a>. We've seen ultra-rich Masters of the Universe before, but now we get the first Masturbator of the Universe.</p><p>The brothel is a one-bedroom operation supervised by Madame (<a href=#>Angela Winkler</a>), a handsome woman of a certain age, who explains that the women have been "prepared" to sleep the whole night through, and the man is invited to sleep next to them (sleeping pills provided) and feast his eyes, or perhaps caress, but no funny business like sticking his fingers in her mouth. Since Madame goes away all night, there's no telling what could happen to these helpless women, of course.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hpq6rlWK8p3nToZxmq5yasrG1zaBkm52RqsGqsdJmaWloaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-jack-sonni-cause-of-death-net-worth-age-career-dire-straits-and-more-674792-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Jack Sonni?
