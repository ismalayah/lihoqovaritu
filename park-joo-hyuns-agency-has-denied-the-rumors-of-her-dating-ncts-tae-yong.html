Many accused the two of being in a relationship since they often teamed up to play online games and the actress was observed watching NCT’s performance from a designated family cubicle.&nbsp;However, 935 Entertainment, Park Joo-company, hyun’s, and SM Entertainment, the male singer’s agency, have both refuted the reports.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NCTs-Tae-yong.jpg alt="NCT's Tae-yong" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition, 935 Entertainment stated:</p><p>“Park Joo-hyun adores games as a pastime and is so fond of them that she uploaded a video on her YouTube channel on online games like League of Legends. She and NCT’s Tae-yong are just pals who like to play video games together. Park Joo-hyun is an extremely sociable person with an extroverted attitude, thus she has many friends and maintains a vast network.”</p><p>The majority of NCT fans did not believe the allegations for a variety of reasons, one of which being that the Kick It singer would not publish a photo of his girlfriend on social media. They were correct, it turns out.&nbsp;Under SM Entertainment, the male vocalist made his debut with NCT in 2016. He is also the group’s leader and a member of its subgroups, NCT U and NCT 127. In 2019, the K-pop star re-debuted in the supergroup SuperM, a collaboration between SM Entertainment and Capitol Records.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Park-Joo-hyun.jpg alt="Park Joo-hyun" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Park Joo-hyun, on the other hand, made her cinematic debut with The Dude in Me in 2019. She eventually went on to star in a number of dramas and films, including Extracurricular, Love All Play, Zombie Detective, Seoul Vibe, Silence, A Piece of Your Mind, Mouse, and others.
