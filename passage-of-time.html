It was when the team made it to the Passage of Time that they were trapped by Dusknoir and the player's past was revealed. Dusknoir's master, <a href=# title="Primal Dialga">Primal Dialga</a> interfered with the time traveling, but Celebi was able to time travel them closer to it.

By instinct, he locates the second Passage of Time and heads towards Vast Ice Mountain to destroy it. It is not revealed what would happen if the Passage of Time were damaged; even Dusknoir does not know, but he recognizes that it would be very dangerous. At the pinnacle, Grovyle, Dusknoir, and Celebi finally confront Primal Dialga. They manage to defeat him before he destroys the Passage of Time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4WutL%2FAoJyYp5aUoaq5xA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./missing-lost-watch-trailer-stephen-kings-under-the-dome.html><span>←</span><span>Missing Lost?
