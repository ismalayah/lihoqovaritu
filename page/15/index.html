Why bother? Why not just pay the guy royalties? Simple: Because Ford thought it could get away with it. He was only a college professor. They had teams of high-priced lawyers with infinite patience. They risked having the legal fees cost them more than the patent rights, but what the hell. You can't go around encouraging these pipsqueaks.
I know that I sound just like a liberal, but at this point in history I am sick and tired of giant corporations running roughshod over decent people -- cutting their wages, polluting their work environment, denying them health care, forcing them to work unpaid overtime, busting their unions and other crimes we have never heard George Bush denouncing while he was cutting corporate taxes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Skywalker Hughes movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>

Ebert Club #125 July 25, 2012 Marie Haws &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2012-07-18 Marie writes: Once upon a time, a long time ago and in a childhood far, far away, kids used to be able to buy a special treat called a Frosted Malt. Then, with the arrival of progress and the subsequent destruction of all that is noble and pure, the world found itself reduced to settling for a frosty at Wendy's, at least where I live.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Juliana Cannarozzo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>
