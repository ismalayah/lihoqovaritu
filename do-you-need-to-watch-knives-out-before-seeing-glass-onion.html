With that being said, Johnson did keep one common element between the films, and that would be Daniel Craig’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">triumphant return as</a> detective Benoit Blanc. Still, the Netflix debut of the much-anticipated sequel has many fans wondering if a viewing of the first one is needed before sitting down to watch the second.</p><h2 id=h-do-you-need-to-watch-knives-out-first data-injectable=false>Do you need to watch Knives Out first?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/glass-onion-daniel-craig.png><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>Despite both movies sharing a similar title, each movie utilizes its own individual plot, with the only plot point joining the projects is the reprisal of Craig as Blanc. Otherwise, you do <strong>not </strong>need to watch Knives Out in order to understand or enjoy Glass Onion. Such a revelation is surely a positive answer, seeing as watching both movies might consume the majority of people’s days. Instead, folks can take enjoyment out of knowing that only sitting through Glass Onion is fine enough on its own.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Aside from Craig’s role, the two movies have obvious differences, with Glass Onion providing moviegoers with a fresh-faced mystery to solve. However, because of Knives Out’s sheer brilliance, scintillating characters, and captivating story, it’s definitely worth noting that while watching the movie isn’t a requirement for seeing the sequel, it’s still a modern-day cinematic masterpiece that deserves a viewing of its own. But of course, we’ll let you be the judge of that.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>Experience the mystery over on Netflix, where Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery is currently streaming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6hlqaTCbrrEnptmrJ9ixKLAwqFkpKaZq7K0ec6uq2aalZu8s7GMrJyeoZ6ceqi4wKyqZqeenryvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-perry-promises-to-remove-random-keanu-reeves-criticisms-from-future-editions-of-his-memoirs.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Perry promises to remove random Keanu Reeves criticisms from future editions of his memoirs</span></a>
