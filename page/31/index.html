Let me give you just one example of the intellectual level of this movie. Grandma (played by Lauren Bacall as "the second lady of the American stage") has a servant who is nine months pregnant. On Christmas morning, everyone assembles at the home in a panic, after the kids have seemingly disappeared. Then the maid feels contractions, and an ambulance and police car are called.
We are informed that the maid has gone into labor on the kitchen floor, and meantime Hallie, Ethan and Ethan's girlfriend arrive at the house, which now has two emergency vehicles parked in front with their lights flashing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ray Toros biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</h2><time>Jun 12, 2024</time>
