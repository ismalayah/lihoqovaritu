<a href=../../../../where-to-watch-milgram-anime.html></a>
The world of anime is ever-expanding, and sometimes, we get to see some truly innovative creations. One of those is Milgram, which can’t quite be described as an anime series — or, at least, not in the traditional sense.
Recommended Videos Unlike other anime and TV shows, Milgram is an interactive project created by DECO*27 and Yamanaka Takuya, that consists of anime music videos that portray an overall story. How does the interaction come into play?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Curb Your Enthusiasm improv?</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../is-curb-your-enthusiasm-improv.html></a>
It’s a question that’s lingered out there more than once over the years.
Recommended Videos Is Curb Your Enthusiasm improv, or is it a scripted show?
Well, the truth, like with a lot of things, lies a bit in the middle. We know in shows that aren’t improv there is usually room for an actor to deviate from the original line a little bit, or to add (or subtract) some nuance to the wording and/or delivery.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who was Jack Sonni?

<a href=../../../../house-of-the-sleeping-beauties-2009.html></a>
The film centers on five scenes in which Edmond, a dying man in his 60s (Vadim Glowna, who also directed), lies in bed next to sleeping nude women of about 20, all breathtakingly beautiful, and delivers a mournful interior soliloquy about his age, their perfection, his mother, a childhood sexual experience and his own misery. This is an intensely depressing experience for Edmond, and for us, intensified by his robotic smoking habit.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Marianne Denicourt movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
