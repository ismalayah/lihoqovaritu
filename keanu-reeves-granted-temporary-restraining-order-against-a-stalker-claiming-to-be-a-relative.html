He gained entry through a side gate as well as hopping over one of the fences around the perimeter. On one occasion Dixon even left a backpack containing a DNA testing kit on Keanu’s property, suggesting he was trying to prove his relation to Reeves.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Keanu-Reeves-in-John-Wick-Chapter-4-e1673915628620.jpg><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Furthermore, Dixon has been posting messages on social media referring to himself as “Jasper Keith Reeves.” Keanu’s legal team deny that the actor has any relation to Dixon whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>A check of Mr. Dixon’s background shows that he has a long list of criminal convictions going back 20 years.
