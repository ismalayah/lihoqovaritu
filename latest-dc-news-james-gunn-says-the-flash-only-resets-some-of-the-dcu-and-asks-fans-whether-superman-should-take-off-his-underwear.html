But Gunn has corrected them saying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that interpretation is too broad</a>. As reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Direct</a>, Gunn states that “Flash&nbsp;resets many things, not all things. Some characters remain the same some do not.” Whether this means any of the OG Justice leaguers will be returning to the fold (especially Aquaman, who also has an anticipated sequel releasing soon) remains to be seen.</p><h2 class=has-medium-font-size data-injectable=false><strong>Do your underpants belong inside or outside? Gunn’s inquiring mind wants to know where his followers fall on the “trunks or no trunks” debate</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/james-gunn-superman.jpg><p data-characters=930 data-current-count=1230 data-injectable=true>It’s a question almost as old as comic books. Should superheroes where their trunks over their costume? Or do away with them entirely? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunn reignited the controversy this week with a poll</a> on Twitter asking his followers what works best: Superman with or without his iconic red trunks? Most onscreen incarnations of the most famous superhero of all have included a pair of trunks worn over (or integrated into) Superman’s well-known blue costume. George Reeves, Christopher Reeves, and Brandon Routh all wore the trunks but Henry Cavill’s Man of Steel opted out, favoring a trunkless version more similar to the character’s New 52 comics relaunch. Gunn insists that the poll is strictly for fun and has nothing to do with the look of the character in Superman: Legacy — but followers continue to weigh in with the be-trunked costume taking a solid lead. And no. There was no <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“commando” option</a>.</p><h2 class=has-medium-font-size data-injectable=false><strong>The epic heartbreak of The Last of Us episode 3 inspires a perfect fan-casting for the DCU The Authority</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Authority-3.jpeg><p data-characters=760 data-current-count=1060 data-injectable=false>Anyone watching The Last of Us is probably seeking out grief counselors if they aren’t still curled into a fetal ball weeping in front of their television after episode 3’s poignant, beautiful, and heartbreaking conclusion. But a few DC fans managed to cry it out long enough to come up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the perfect fan-casting for DC’s The Authority</a>. And TLOU stars Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett, who star as lovers Bill and Frank, would absolutely kill it as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Authority’s longtime couple The Midnighter and Apollo</a>. While the pair might be a bit older than the superheroic partners, there is no denying the similar chemistry between the two. A little bit of make-up and CGI could have the pair ready to step into their respective costumes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8uaq56rpGKxpHnNnq6sZZqWuqa%2FjKCsp6ZdqK66v4ytn55llqGutLSMqKWlsV2nsrSx06xkrKedmnqwsoytn55llJjCbq3NnWSaq5uoeqetzaxksKCVqbWmvoysrKmdoqKur3nSoaaupJRiwaK3xGamn55dnba0edSnm56qp5qus3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./claudia-haro.html><span>←</span><span>Claudia Haro</span></a>
