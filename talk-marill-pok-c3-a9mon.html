I believe the region is assumed to be based off of France, and I think France also has the "mouse tooth-fairy" version of the myth. It might not be the only reason, but it's possibly and influence as to why Marill's type is Water/Fairy. <a href=# title=User:Takoto><span>- <b>Takoto</b></span></a> 14:53, 12 June 2013 (UTC)</p>Proof? <a href=# title="User:Me, Hurray!">Me, Hurray!</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Me, Hurray!">talk</a>) 21:19, 13 June 2013 (UTC)<h2><span id=Marill.27s_appearance></span><span class=mw-headline id="Marill's_appearance">Marill's appearance</span></h2><p>Can someone please upgrade Marill's minor role appearances of the episodes <i><a href=# title=BW103>Curtain Up, Unova League!</a></i>, <i><a href=# title=BW105>Lost at the League!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title="Mewtwo — Prologue to Awakening">Mewtwo — Prologue to Awakening</a></i>?
