Many online content creators get their start in the same way: as young people, making and uploading content with no real plan for what it will lead to. These creators usually see their careers grow out of nowhere, after they discover a knack for editing, comedy, or commentary.
Recommended Videos Unlike many of his fellow YouTube creators, Dhar Mann always intended for his YouTube uploads to become a long-term career. The entrepreneur and former real estate mogul hasn’t been on the site for long, but his well-planned approach and reliable upload schedule keep new subscribers flooding in.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Chrisean Rock and what is she famous for?</h2><time>Jul 5, 2024</time>

There’s a fine line between a charming, cheeky social media presence and simply being unprofessional and unwilling to own up to mistakes. Companies like Ryanair and Wendy’s toe this tightrope excellently, and their slightly insulting social media accounts chime nicely with what their brands represent. But when it goes wrong, it goes terribly wrong, as shown by the latest Netflix tweet about the Love is Blind reunion livestream, well, not going live.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Super Mario Crossover 2.0 Has Gone Live</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos Last month, we told you about Super Mario Crossover 2.0, the Flash game taking favorites of old and putting them into a pixel perfect replication of Super Mario Bros. Well, the update has finally gone live and it’s absolutely glorious. The characters all control just as you’d expect them to, and being able to play a pseudo Game Boy version of Bass running around world 1-1 is making the 80s kid in me squeel with absolute joy.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>15 of the strangest things The Simpsons has predicted</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../15-of-the-strangest-things-the-simpsons-has-predicted.html></a>
The Simpsons is a show that has been running since 1989. Since then, the jokes, story plots, and scenes presented have somehow managed to consistently predict future events. From Trump’s presidency to technological developments, The Simpsons has seen it all. While all of this could be dismissed as coincidence, especially considering the show’s long run, life seems to have managed to imitate art as more similarities and predictions constantly emerge as the years go by.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Donald Wildmon Obituary</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../mandingo-1975.html></a>
In the wretched potboiler (4.5 million copies in print) from which this piece of manure was made, the master goes on to boil Mede down into soup, which he pours on the grave of the unfaithful wife. One cannot say that taste restrained the filmmakers from adding this additional touch, since "Mandingo" betrays not the slightest sign of taste, but perhaps they didn't want to unduly delay the ending, in which James Mason dies not only as a character but surely in spirit.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Source Code Review [SXSW]</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../the-rings-of-power-is-adar-what-happens-when-elves-lose-the-light-of-the-valar.html></a>
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power has expanded Tolkien lore by introducing a concept known as the “light of the Valar,” without which the very souls of Elves will perish. Is that what happened to Adar?
Recommended Videos As an Elf who seems to carry authority with the Orcs, Adar is already a very mysterious addition to the world of Middle-earth. During the latest episode, The Rings of Power all but confirmed that the villain is not Sauron, and taking his pointy ears into account, we’ll definitely have to look toward the Elven-kind in Tolkien’s roster to puzzle out his identity.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/23/>← Prev Page</a>
