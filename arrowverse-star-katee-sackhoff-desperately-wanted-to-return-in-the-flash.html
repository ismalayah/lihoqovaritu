So, I tried!”</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Further into the interview, when the podcast host disclosed that it was a “bummer” that Sackhoff wasn’t asked to reprise her role and mentioned that many other people could be facing the same predicament, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the actress</a> agreed.
