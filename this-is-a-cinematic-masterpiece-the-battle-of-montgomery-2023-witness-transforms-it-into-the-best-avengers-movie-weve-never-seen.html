A group of white men attacked a Black dock worker after he asked them to move their pontoon boot so a riverboat could dock. At one point, more than five white people attack the worker at once.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Then a group of Black men, some of them riverboat crew members alongside the worker who was attacked, approach the pontoon boat faction and fighting breaks out even more! Then police officers show up, and at one point, a guy hits someone with a chair. There’s even a guy, reportedly another riverboat crew member, who swims over to help it’s really wild.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>There are a lot of videos of this. Like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a>. Or this one with Sam Cooke’s “A Change is Gonna Come” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">overlayed on top</a> of it. There’s been a lot of variations of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this one too</a> (buying a chair in Walmart).</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>One parody in particular has gone pretty viral, stacking up more than 1.2 million likes. TikTok user kendria_bland made a video where the “Avengers,” well, a different version of the Avengers, with names like Hulkeon and Thor-ontae, take on the white people.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman are there as well. It’s spectacular and perfect in tone.
