Doctor Who: Flux — the 13th season of the sci-fi series that comprised a six-part miniseries — has to be one of the most ambitious runs of the modern show, as it took place across time and space and was stacked full of allies and enemies, new and old. One of the new allies was Karvanista, a canine alien with a curmudgeonly attitude who was really a loveable furball, as he helped the Doctor and her friends save the Earth multiple times.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Spot A Bootleg | Page 4</h2><time>Sep 24, 2024</time>

Super corporation Ticketmaster is already in hot water over the Taylor Swift ticket pre-sale fiasco, but it looks like things are still bottoming out because now we’re hearing from the disabled community of Swifties, who are saying they waited online for hours only to be told accessible seating was not available. The tickets they did find were exorbitantly overpriced.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for both the manga and the live-action adaptation of One Piece.
Recommended Videos It’s become somewhat of an inside joke within the One Piece fandom that author Eiichiro Oda rarely kills his characters; so when he does commit to killing off a character, fans take note. That may be changing if this character’s fate in the live-action Netflix adaptation is anything to go by.
One Piece isn’t afraid to tackle serious subject matter — recent manga chapters have been particularly heavy — but Oda often comes short of letting characters die.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tenants collective protest NYT Crossword Clue Answer</h2><time>Sep 22, 2024</time>

“Biosphere” has a curious premise that’s briskly unpacked within the movie’s first half hour. [SOME ESSENTIAL SPOILERS FOLLOW] In that time, insecure Billy (Duplass) and overweening Ray (Brown) discover that they’re not only trapped in a biodome that is&nbsp;running out of food but also that one of the fish that they’re raising for their own dietary needs has suddenly and unexpectedly become a hermaphrodite. This evolutionary leap coincides with an even bigger plot contrivance: Billy’s also spontaneously undergoing intersex changes, which freaks him out and intrigues Ray, formerly a biologist.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cold Creek Manor movie review (2003)</h2><time>Sep 21, 2024</time>

The movie stars Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone as Cooper and Leah Tilson, who get fed up with the city and move to the country, purchasing a property that looks like the House of the Seven Gables crossed with the Amityville Horror. This house is going to need a lot of work. In "Under the Tuscan Sun," another new movie, Diane Lane is able to find some cheerful Polish workers to rehab her Tuscan villa, but the Tilsons have the extraordinarily bad judgment to hire the former owner of the house, Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff), an ex-con with a missing family.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=next href=../../categories/blog/page/2/>Next Page →</a></nav></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=../../></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
