The man could play any number of characters in the upcoming show, and the story can go in countless directions. There are a few factions that might translate to the screen better than others, however, and we’d love to see a few make the final cut.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Cavill is far from the only celebrity to enjoy a good game of Warhammer, and fans are delighting in the news that a number of favorites join Cavill in geeking out over the popular title.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Warhammer 40K factions that Amazon should absolutely include</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Warhammer_factions-e1671216036252.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>There are quite a few factions across Warhammer 40K lore, and — while the show will likely nod to all of them at some point —some are bound to get more attention than others. Based on a range of factors, including Henry Cavill’s own preferences, we think five factions, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more than any others</a>, would make wonderful additions to Amazon’s upcoming series.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Cavill isn’t the only celeb who loves Warhammer 40K</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/robin-williams.jpg><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>News of a Warhammer adaptation sent shockwaves through the game’s broad fanbase, and quickly sparked renewed interest in star Henry Cavill’s longstanding passion for the game.

It was only weeks ago that he was announcing his return to the role of Superman, after all, only to have the newly-helmed DC ditch the actor for a younger model. Rumors that Cavill would instead become the next Bond quickly began to swirl, only to be upended by the Warhammer news. If Cavill was offered the role to helm the next run of Bond films, some fans think he’d <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ditch the Warhammer franchise entirely</a>, but longtime fans of the actor aren’t so sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S5osDErKtmr5GntaK5zJ6pZqaVrMBurdJmqa6ln6fAbq%2FAr6ClpF2stq24jJucraqRrnq4rdGhmKallad6dXzKZp2oql2XvK%2BwjJujqK9dqr1uwMeeZJ%2BZnpm8rnnMqKmeZaOasLOx02aanqSVl7%2BqwNhmp6WZqZq%2FtHnAq5xmrZ6irrS3xJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kip-wightman-wife-amber-wightman-why-did-they-split-2.html><span>←</span><span>Kip Wightman Wife Amber Wightman Why did They Split?</span></a>
