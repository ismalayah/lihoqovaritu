The two foveae—the central fovea and temporal fovea—have different roles. The temporal fovea enables the peregrine falcon to see close objects in sharp detail when the bird is using its binocular vision (looking through both eyes). <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on pbslearningmedia.org</a><h2>How is a falcon's eyesight critical to its existence?</h2>Extremely acute vision and the ability to rapidly process different visual impressions are crucial for a peregrine falcon as it dives down on its prey at the speed of a Formula One racing car -- over 350 kilometers per hour, according to the researchers. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on indiatoday.in</a><h2>Are falcons colorblind?</h2>Birds have exceptionally keen vision.
