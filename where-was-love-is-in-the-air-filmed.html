Recommended Videos The film certainly seems to be gaining traction for Goodrem’s likable performance, as well as Sasse’s acting chops as William – a gentlemanly, ever so slightly awkward Hugh Grant-esque character – and Aboriginal comedian Steph Tisdell in only her second film role as Dana’s best friend Nikki, who thinks nothing of egging Dana on when it comes to William."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Situated on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef, the islands have in recent times become a popular tourist destination for sailors and snorkelers alike. Although the main island has a population of around 1350 people, most of the other 70 or so islands in the group are uninhabited, making the seaplane Goodrem flies in the film a natural choice for island-hoppers. The movie was partly funded by the state organization for fostering the film industry, Screen Queensland.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6uK3SZqOorpVitrR5yKdkraCVYq6qvoyfoKWllZl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paige-shows-off-new-look-after-breast-augmentation-surgery-mother-reacts.html><span>←</span><span>Paige Shows Off New Look After Breast Augmentation Surgery Mother Reacts</span></a>
