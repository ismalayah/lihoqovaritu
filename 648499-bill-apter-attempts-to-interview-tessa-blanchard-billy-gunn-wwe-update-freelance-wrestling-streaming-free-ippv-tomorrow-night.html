This video was filmed over the weekend at WrestleCade. In the below clip Apter attempts to interview <a href=#>Tessa Blanchard</a> but is caught by surprise when he is interrupted by <a href=#>Harlem Heat</a>, <a href=#>ODB</a>, The Mulkeys and more…</p><p></p><p>You can catch Bill Apter’s latest installment of Apter’s Alley&nbsp;alongside myself on&nbsp;tomorrow’s episode of <a href=#>WrestleZone Daily</a>. You can catch it live at Noon EST here on WrestleZone or as soon as it’s available in archive form by subscribing to iTunes .</p><h2>Billy Gunn-WWE Performance Center Update</h2><p>Earlier today WrestleZone Daily featured <a href=#>Great Lake Championship Wrestling</a> Owner <a href=#>Dave Herro</a> as it’s featured guest. Dave was on the show to discuss GLCW’s biggest show of the year this Saturday, <a href=#>Blizzard Brawl</a>, as well as his&nbsp;Monster’s Ball match on the show with TNA Superstar <a href=#>Abyss</a>. We will have transcribed quotes from what Dave had to say about that tomorrow on the site.</p><p>During Dave’s appearance I brought up that one of the featured talents for Blizzard Brawl, <a href=#>Chyna</a>, recently was seen in a photo alongside <a href=#>Billy Gunn</a>.</p><p>When I asked Dave if he was surprised to see Billy posing with Chyna so soon after his release from the WWE he casually confirmed the speculation that Billy Gunn would be returning in the future as a trainer to WWE NXT. Below is the full transcript of his quote as well as the full audio.</p><p>DH: First of all, Billy has been a friend of mine for a long time. He’s had his set backs. If he wouldn’t have been tested by the World Bodybuilding or whatever it was… nobody would have known anything. It’s just unfortunate. He will be back as an NXT trainer soon. Joanie and Billy go way back. It’s unfortunate the way she left the company and how things happened for her as she was gone from the company. It’s still a brotherhood. It’s still a big family. At the end of the day, anyone who is involved in the world of pro wrestling you are kind of a misfit to begin with. The Island of Wrestling is The Island of Misfit Toys. We can all get mad at each other or whatever else but we are always going to be friends and family and wish the best for everybody.&nbsp;</p><h2>Freelance Wrestling Live Streaming Update</h2><p>Tomorrow night Chicago independent pro wrestling company <a href=#>Freelance Wrestling</a> will be presenting it’s latest live event RAW Power as a FREE iPPV.</p><p>WrestleZone will have the live stream of the event pinned to the top of our page starting at 10:45 pm EST until the event finishes around 1:30 am EST.
