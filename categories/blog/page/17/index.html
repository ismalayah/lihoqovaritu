Netflix’s new rom-com Love Is In the Air dropped earlier this week, with singer and former soap star Delta Goodrem playing Dana, a private pilot whose tiny business is due to be shut down by a young executive (Joshua Sasse) trying to prove himself to his businessman father.
Recommended Videos The film certainly seems to be gaining traction for Goodrem’s likable performance, as well as Sasse’s acting chops as William – a gentlemanly, ever so slightly awkward Hugh Grant-esque character – and Aboriginal comedian Steph Tisdell in only her second film role as Dana’s best friend Nikki, who thinks nothing of egging Dana on when it comes to William.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Explore Terry Bradshaw's Wife Tammy Bradshaw's Relationship Details, Wiki, Parents, &amp;amp; Net Worth</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../first-images-revealed-from-amazons-jack-reacher-series.html></a>
Christopher McQuarrie’s Jack Reacher was a satisfyingly old-school action thriller, one that saw Tom Cruise play a fairly grounded character that didn’t have much interest in saving the world. He was rough, ready, and happy to get his hands dirty, but fans of the source material could never reconcile themselves with how short he was.
Recommended Videos In the literary series, the hulking military investigator is almost an entire foot taller than the diminutive Mission: Impossible star and built like a brick sh*thouse, so Amazon is going back to the drawing board with upcoming series Reacher, which is coming to streaming in February 2022.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/16/>← Prev Page</a>
