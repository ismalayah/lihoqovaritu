And does this have anything to do with what Gil-galad said to Elrond about the Elves losing the light of the Valar?</p><h2 id=h-adar-and-losing-the-light-of-the-valar data-injectable=false><strong>Adar and losing the light of the Valar</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Featured-Image-of-The-Rings-of-Power.jpg><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=780 data-injectable=true>After confronting Gil-galad for his deception involving the Dwarves, Elrond learns that the Elves of Lindon are somehow “losing the light of the Valar.” This could either be referring to the light of the Two Trees, whose remnants have all but perished by the time The Rings of Power takes place, or it could be hinting at a larger abstract idea – that the Elves are simply diminishing in strength due to choosing to remain in Middle-earth after the war with Morgoth.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, in another scene, Adar is shown staring at a tree and the light sifting through it with a longing gaze. This has led to some speculation in the fandom that whatever “losing the light of the Valar” turns out to be, Adar is someone who has already succumbed to that terrible fate.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Does that explain why he takes pity on Orcs, who are Elves that were twisted by the evil of Morgoth? Is it Adar’s fate to ultimately become an Orc himself, since he’s already showing the wear and tear of time and destiny on his scarred face? All interesting musings, though until The Rings of Power explicitly confirms or dismisses them, all we have to go on is wild speculation.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>The Rings of Power is returning with its sixth episode on Friday, so let’s hope that we’ll finally learn more about Adar and his motivations for stirring up trouble in the Southlands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmqaKml6h6sLKMqaawnaJitrR5wJ2Yq2Wnna61eceap6mdnqh6uLTEp2SepKaawG64zqycZqyYmnqttcahq2anlmLBqbGMr5ilmaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./source-code-review.html><span>←</span><span>Source Code Review [SXSW]</span></a>
